# OpenCV-face-recognizer
This is a work in progress project involving face recognition using openCV. The program opens a frame that utilizes the user's webcam from their laptop in order to display a live video with a box that surrounds faces that are detected. The Haar Cascade(s) that are/will be used are mostly from the default ones that come with openCV, but some will be trained by myself in the future. The project so far uses Python and openCV, and any images are either from the webcam produced by the user, or obtained from the internet.

## Motivation
Computer vision, machine learning, and artifical intelligence are all hot topics of the future; self-driving cars will depend on computer vision to function, as well as on both machine learning and artificial intelligence to operate. Learning how to operate computer vision and machine learning is analagous to learning some fundamental vocabulary while visiting a foreign country; while it may not be required, it's certainly beneficial to know a little bit of it in order to communicate effectively and enjoy your time.
